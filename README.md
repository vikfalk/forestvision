# ForestVision üõ∞Ô∏è

ForestVision is a web-based tool designed to analyze deforestation over a specified period using satellite imagery. This application allows users to select geographic coordinates and a time frame to visualize changes in forest cover and quantify the extent of deforestation. 

![Mock-up_1x](https://github.com/vikfalk/deforestation_frontend/assets/165885171/483ef44f-ded0-4660-90da-8ed36125fd69)
## Features

- **Geographic Selection**: Select any location globally using latitude and longitude inputs.
- **Time Frame Specification**: Define the start and end dates to analyze deforestation within that period.
- **Image Processing**: Retrieve and process satellite images to identify and visualize forest cover changes.
- **Interactive Map**: Display the selected area on an interactive map with an overlay indicating the deforested area.
- **Deforestation Metrics**: Calculate and display key metrics, including the percentage of forest cover loss, total deforested area in hectares, and annual CO2 loss due to deforestation.
